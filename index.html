    <h1>GitHub Tutorial</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work
            together on projects from anywhere.

            This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll
            create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and
            review code.

            In this quickstart guide, you will:

            Create and use a repository
            Start and manage a new branch
            Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
            Open and merge a pull request</p>
        <h2>Step 1: Create a local git repository </h2>
        <p>
            When creating a new project on your local machine using git, you'll first create a new repository (or often,
            'repo', for short).
        </p>
        <h2>Step 2: Add a new file to the repo</h2>
        <p>            
            Go ahead and add a new file to the project, using any text editor you like or running a touch command. `touch newfile.txt` just creates and saves a blank file named newfile.txt. 
        </p>
        <h2>            Step 3: Add a file to the staging environment</h2>
        <p>
            Add a file to the staging environment using the git add command. 
            If you rerun the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment (notice the "Changes to be committed" line). 
        </p>
        <h2>Step 4: Create a commit</h2>
        <p>            
            It's time to create your first commit!
            Run the command git commit -m "Your message about the commit"
        </p>
